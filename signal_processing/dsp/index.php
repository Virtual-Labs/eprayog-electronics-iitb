<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>
  With the rapid development in the digital computers, digital signal processing has become a viable alternative to analog signal processing. Recognizing this trend in this technology, digital signal processing was introduced in university curriculum at UG/PG level. However, in most engineering colleges in India it is being taught mainly as a theory course. The laboratory component of this course, if any, mainly contain MATLAB tutorials/assignments. Students rarely get opportunity to work on actual processors.
e-Prayog extends the help to all the students who are eager to learn DSP.
