<h1>Signals & Systems</h1>
</br>
<p>
Signals are at the core of many real-life applications, ranging from communication to medical technology. In particular, the interaction of various systems and the non-idealities in them constitute a fundamental area of study.</p>
<p> The Signals and Systems Virtual Lab allows students to perform simulation-based experiments that cover a wide range of topics; to name a few: sampling & quantization, frequency-domain analysis, study of various kinds of filters etc.
<p> MATLAB is a popular software for performing such experiments. However, it is unaffordably expensive for students to try out the examples outside their college hours. The Signals and Systems laboratory uses Scilab for all the experiments, because it is a free alternative to MATLAB.
<p> All the necessary help regarding Scilab is available is provided <a href="scilab">here</a>.
