<h3> <b> Objectives of e-Prayog </b></h3> </br>
<ul>
<li> To provide remote access to experimental set-ups.
<li> To share costly equipments and resources.   
<li> To provide web resources, video tutorials, interactive demos, and tests for self evaluation.
<li> To help students learn basic and advanced concepts at their own pace. 
<li> To encourage and help students to use public-domain  and open-source  software for simulation.
</ul>
<h2> <b>Salient features of e-Prayog </b></h2> </br>
<p> <b> Theory: </b>  "Learning by doing with the help of interactive tutorials".  </br>
	<b> Simulation: </b> using public-domain/open-source software.</br>
	<b> Remote triggered experiments:  </b>
<ul>
<li> In the devices and circuits lab, users can choose component values and observe its effect in an actual experimental set-up from a remote site.
<li> In the DSP/FPGA based lab, the users can upload their own program, run it on a real DSP/FPGA System at IITB, and observe the results from a remote site. 
</ul>
