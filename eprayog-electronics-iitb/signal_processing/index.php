<h1>Signal Processing</h1>
</br>
<p>
Signal processing involves taking an input signal, performing some action on the signal to generate a new waveform as the output. The action may be amplification, filtering or any other function applied on the signal. 
All signals in nature are continuous. So what is the need to go for Digital Signal Processing? The answer lies in the evolution of signal processing. Previously i.e. in 1950's and 1960's, much work was being done on creating analog computers which could process the continuous time waveforms available in nature. However, it turned out to be quite a task to work with them as they proved to be inflexible, slow and difficult to reconfigure. During that period a great amount of work was being done to develop digital systems so that complex algorithms could be coded easily. The advantage that digital signals could be processed much easily, quickly and efficiently led to the development of Digital signal processing.
<p>
As digital systems began to evolve, many new algorithms were being developed which had very high level of complexity. Most of the operations in digital signal processing involved multiplication or division. General purpose processors took a long time to perform these operations making the algorithm less effective.  Thus, the general purpose processors were no longer fast enough and reliable to be used for such purposes. This led to the development of a new set of processors called Digital signal processors. Digital signal processors could do the same operations very quickly and efficiently.

This course provides us a step by step approach to understand the basics of signal processing. We first understand the concepts of different actions which could be performed on signals like shifting, folding and convolution. This is extended further to the design of filters and their implementation on Digital signal processor thereby covering all the aspects of Digital Signal Processing.
