<h1>Image Processing Labs</h1>
<p>
  Image processing is a field that finds important applications across several areas of science and technology. The subject is multidisciplinary in nature, and it is offered by electrical, electronics, communications, instrumentation, computer science and IT departments at various levels of the undergraduate and postgraduate levels as an elective course.  The subject of image processing is highly mathematical and thus requires very strong signal processing background.  Students usually find it difficult to relate the concepts of the subject with the image processing algorithms, and to understand the practical implications of the same. Therefore, we at the Wadhwani Electronics Lab, IIT Bombay propose a virtual lab for image processing, which will facilitate students at remote locations to understand the basic principles of the subject, and importantly to gain practical knowledge of the algorithms in the subject with the effective use of interactive multimedia.  The experiments based on simulations will be developed using an open source platform.
