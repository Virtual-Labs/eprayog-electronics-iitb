<h1>Welcome to Virtual Labs</h1>
<p>
  Physical distances and the lack of resources make us unable to perform experiments, especially when they involve sophisticated instruments. Also, good teachers are always a scarce resource. Web-based and video-based courses address the issue of teaching to some extent. Conducting joint experiments by two participating institutions and also sharing costly resources has always been a challenge. With the present day internet and computer technologies the above limitations can no more hamper students and researchers in enhancing their skills and knowledge. Also, in a country such as ours, costly instruments and equipment need to be shared with fellow researchers to the extent possible.

<h1>WEL Remote Lab (WRL) / WEL Virtual Lab (WELViL)</h1>
<p>
  The WEL Remote Lab (WRL) / WEL Virtual Lab (WELViL) will cater to requirements of students in the field of Electronics. More specifically WRL would be involved in developing DSP, FPGA and CPLD Remote Labs. Simulation of user written programs alongwith the intended remotely controllable hardware will be provided. 
</p>
<p>
  As of now, the working setup includes a setup (DSP board) which can be remotely programmed by a registered user. The setup also includes an arbitrary Function Generator and Digital Storage Oscilloscope (DSO) which can be controlled remotely as per the users needs. Basic Experiments on the DSP namely filter design with its desired frequency response have been tested successfully. Registration of new users as well as a registered user database is ready.
